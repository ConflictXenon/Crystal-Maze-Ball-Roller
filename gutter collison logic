- ball to only start dropping when we tell it to
- once ball is moving, each frame it should assess whether it is in a supported area or not
    - if it is, then continue
    - if it is not, then error / gameover / reset

- how to define what is a supported area
    - an array of supported areas
        per area
            - x0 to xMax
            - y0 to yMax

supported area definition
- gutter top left
- use width to infer other corners

ball area calculation
- ball top left
- use width to infer other corners (top right, bottom left, bottom right)

supported area calculation (SATRP = supported area top right pixel, BTLP = ball top left pixel)
- is BTLP:
    - both
        - BTLP left <= SABRP left
        - BTLP top <= SABRP top
- is BTRP:
    - both
        - BTRP left => SABLP left
        - BTRP top <= SABLP top
is BBLP:
    - both
        - BBLP left <= SATRP left
        - BBLP top >= SATRP top
is BBRP:
    - both
        - BBRP left >= SATLP left
        - BBRP top >= SATLP top
        
        
        
need to know the left and top for every gutter corner, and every ball corner
